    <h1> College vs. University Dropout Rates</h1>
    <p>For this project I wanted to explore college and university dropout rates and contributing factors (affordability). Also the success of those who didn't pursue higher education. I've always been told that the only way to be truly successful is to go to college, but there are people who didn't do so who are better off than those who did.</p>
